# Introduction

Thailand is one of tourist favorite destinations.  The tourism industry contributes significantly to Thailand economic growth.  In 2016, the industry contributes to 17.7% of the nation's GDP.  **TAT** (Tourism Authority of Thailand) has a mission of promoting tourism in Thailand.  

**Amazing Thailand** is a successful tourist campaign issued by TAT.  Recently, TAT issued **Discover Thainess** tourist initiative as a supplement to the existing campaign.  The new campaign provides foreign visitors with Thai culture experience such as Thai fun, food, wellness, wisdom, and art.

In this report, our hypothetical non-profit organization is trying to help TAT by proposing **Tour Detour** initiative.  The purpose is to gain more local tourists.  We target Thai people who rarely travel.  By encouraging them to start small, which is by taking a little detour from their usual route, they might be interested in visit a tourist attraction.
